\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OK
	More and more people around the world have started to understand the importance of air quality and how much having clean and pollution-free air can influence our lives, both on the small and large scale. 
	To have clean air, all of us have to do something to avoid polluting it. \\
	The Government of Luxembourg has set a good example becoming the first country to offer nationwide free public transport to the citizens\cite{luxemburg}.\\
	For short commutes, vehicles like the classic bike\cite{bike}, the infamous skateboard and the scooter have started to arise and conquer cities, either in their battery-powered or old-school human-powered.\\
	Since not everyone necessarily owns one of these green methods of transportation, companies like \textit{Mobike}\cite{mobike} and \textit{MiMoto}\cite{mimoto} have seen the opportunity to enter the market of shared transportation, proposing a \textit{pay-per-use} solution for bikes, electric scooters and other similar vehicles.	
	Each company has its own application, network infrastructure and smart devices aboard their vehicles, gathering data like GPS (Global Positioning System) position, time spent by the user, parking spot, etc. to send it in the cloud and compute information like cost of the ride and charging it to the user.\\
	All this falls under the \textit{IoT} (Internet of Things) paradigm, which has become a well-described market with new ideas and business opportunities being presented every day.\\
	Among the data collected by these companies, none is about air pollution.\\
	In this article, I describe \textit{ArduECO}, a wireless device based on an Arduino-like board capable of gathering data from previously named vehicles and sending it to the cloud, to be processed and displayed.\\

\section{Proposed solution}\label{solution}
	
	ArduECO is a wireless IoT device that represents one of the possible combinations of open source hardware and software.
	% DIRE COSA EFFETTIVAMENTE VIENE CATTURATO, COSA CHE DEVE ESSERE DISCUSSA NEL PARAGRAFO PRECEDENTE
	\hlcyan{This wireless device is able to detect substances in the air and send the data in the cloud over Wi-Fi, and combined with data from other similar devices detect the level of pollution in the air.}\\
	The schematics for this project have been designed using Fritzing, a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software for the design of electronics hardware\cite{fritzing} and can be seen in Fig.~\ref{schematics}.
	Both code and schematics for this device are available on the GitHub repository ``ArduECO''\cite{ardueco_git}.\\
	Schematics for other components can be easily found online from various sources and vendors: here, for example are the schematics for the MQ7 sensor from SparkFun\cite{spark_mq} and the NodeMCU\cite{node_scheme}.
	
	\subsection{The circuit}\label{circuit}
	
		ArduECO is composed by four main components:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textit{NodeMCU}: it's the hearts and brains of the device, this board is an open-source development kit based on the ESP8266 chip that allows for prototyping of IoT devices;
			\item \textit{MicroSD card reader}: this allow for collecting and keeping data cached for the current ride and permanently on a removable memory card;
			\item \textit{GPS sensor}: this allows for localizing the device, it has an onboard LED that blinks when it has established communication with the satellites;
			% AGGIUNGERE COSA RACCOGLIE ESATTAMENTE QUESTO SENSORE
			\item \hlcyan{\textit{MQ sensor}: the MQ sensor used in this project is MQ7 but it can easily be exchanged with other sensors that use the same board and connectors.}
		\end{itemize}
		The other components, LEDs and button, are used as I/O for interacting with the user.\\
		In \ref{improvements} I explain how the project can be improved both in hardware and software.
		\begin{figure}[htbp]
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{fig1.png}}
			\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
			\label{schematics}
		\end{figure}
		In Fig.~\ref{schematics} there is no indication of a power supply since for this prototype version it has been powered using an external battery with a standard output of 5V and 1A.
	
	\subsection{The Arduino software}
	
		The reasons behind the choice of using Arduino's programming language instead of micropython \cite{micropyhton} because of the large community behind and interoperability with other boards.
		The main functions in the Arduino programming language are ``\textit{void setup()[]}'' and ``\textit{void loop()[]}''.
		The first one runs once at the boot of the device to initialize and set the initial values while the second one does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing the program to change and respond.
		The main file that contains these functions and that board executes is ArduECO.ino.
		In here the setup function contains the instructions in order to correctly initialize the serial communication with the GPS module, create the files in the sd card, initialize the pinouts, gathering the certificates for communicating with its cloud component and creating a random id for identifying the ride.
		
		An important part of the configuration of the device is the file parametets.json
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
    {
	  "ssid" : "",
	  "password" : "",
	  "in_topic" : "",
	  "out_topic" : "",
	  "endpoint" : ""
    }
		\end{lstlisting}
		If this file is not present in the sd card at boot-time the device will not end the boot sequence returning an error and rebooting after 10 seconds.
		Here we set the network ssid and password it is supposed to connect to, the topics for communicating with the mqtt server and its endpoint.
		In the loop function the board acquires a reading of its surrundings every 5 seconds by first detecting if the GPS has a fix (which can be seen on the board when the led blinks blue) and by reading the MQ sensor.
		Each read is then appended on two separate files in json format: cache\_log.txt and perm\_log.txt. The firts one is created each time the board boots and it regards each single session while the second one contains the information of all the rides.
		
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]		
    {
	  "id":"127",
	  "air":"18.22",
	  "lt":"45.39641",
	  "lg":"11.88527",
	  "dt":"50320.12173900",
	  "tpc":"ardueco_proto_01_OUT"
    }
		\end{lstlisting}	
		The two leds that are attached to the board are used not only to communicate when the board has finished the setup sequence or in case of errors but for indicating wheter the ssid specified in the params file is in range and whether the board is transmitting data or not.
		When the button is pressed the board searches the list of networks in range for the specified one and, if present, it connects to it and establishes communication with the MQTT server specified by sending it a message with the number of reads that will be sent.
		Each row of the cache file is then sent to the server and at the end of this sequence the cache file is deleted and created again awaiting new reads.
		The other files that implement this project contain specific functions for either setting up the device or connecting the the server.
		All of them can be found in the github repo associated with this project.
		
	\subsection{The cloud}
	
		The cloud part of this project is divided between AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Altervista.
		From AWS the services that are used are IoT and lambda which are easy to set up and are highly interconnectable with multiple architectures.
		At first when the button on the ArduECO is pressed the message is sent to an MQTT server in AWS IoT.
		To connect to this server the devices need to use certificates downloaded and buned into the devices memory when the code is sent in it using the arduino IDE.
		The MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) server designed as a lightweight messaging protocol that uses publish/subscribe operations to exchange data between clients and the server So, it’s easy to implement in software and fast in data transmission (https://1sheeld.com/mqtt-protocol/)
		The MQTT server in the AWS IoT console is then connected to a serverless lambda function, triggered each time a new message arrives from the ardueco.
		This python function receives in input the message and sends it to a php file on the webserver that inserts it in the database, hosted on the free website hosting altervista.org under the url ardueco.altervista.org.
		
		The webpage of the website displays the routes that are stored and each marker indicates a reading.

		\end{figure}
	
		In the improbements section i'll explain some modifications that could improve the system
	
	\subsection{Hardware cost}
		Because most of these parts are open source they can be found sold on various websites from many vendors.
		Here are some examples of the prices taken from the site aliexpess at the time of writing.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item NodeMCU \footnote{\url{https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32879925927.html}}: $ \sim $ 2\euro
			\item MicroSD car reader \footnote{\url{https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32572793362.html}}: $ \sim $ 0.50\euro
			\item GPS sensor \footnote{\url{https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32836015224.html}}: $ \sim $ 3.5\euro
			\item MQ gas sensor \footnote{\url{https://it.aliexpress.com/item/4000575957425.html}}: $ \sim $ 1\euro
		\end{itemize}
		In total the main components $\sim$ 7\euro, considering the shipping and the cost of the other components (cables, leds, button, sd card) it can amount to less than 15\euro.
		Keep in mind that these prices are valid for a single piece and that in case of bulk purchase it would be much lower.

\section{Future improvements}\label{improvements}

	In this section 
	
	\subsection{Hardware improvements}
	
		There are various improvements that could be made to the circuit and the hardware used, for example in this project using one single air quality sensor could be seen as a drawback since we could take advantage of the cheapness of these sensors
		
		It is possible to add multiple sensors by expanding the analog inputs using an \textit{Analog to Digital Converter} (ADC)
		
		that converts an analog voltage on a pin to a digital number. By converting from the analog world to the digital world, we can begin to use electronics to interface to the analog world around us.\cite{adc}
	
		In case we would want to use another transmission medium instead of wifi we could think about switching boards and use an arduino leonardo or an arduino uno or whatever iteration possible
		
		5gh board
		
		Given the small dimensions of the components, this project could be easily fitted inside of a custom made box.
		A solution could be to 3D print one and designing it based on the and considering that the air sensor should remain outside of the plastic and that the whole project could be exposed to high levels of humidity (in the winter season e.g.).
	
	\subsection{Software improvements}
	
		Supposed we use the same architecture we can improve the software such that instead of looking for the ap and snding the data only when the button is pressef it could be set such that 
		
	\subsection{Cloud services improvements}
	
		In the development of this project I was forced by the we server host altervista.org to connect to the database only from within
		
		connections within its domain
		
		i was not able to allow the lambda to insert the data directly in the database, so I was forced to create an intermediate webpage to insert that data
		
		for this reason a possible improvement could be 

\section{Conclusions and future work}
This paper describes the implementation of a wireless IoT system capable to gather data from air and send it to the cloud in order to be analyzed and displayed.

%\subsection{Units}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
%\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
%\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
%\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{Equations}
%Number equations consecutively. To make your 
%equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
%appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
%but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
%sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
%sentence, as in:
%\begin{equation}
%a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
%\end{equation}
%
%Be sure that the 
%symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
%the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
%the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''
%
%\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}
%
%Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
%of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
%to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of ures or
%citations without having to go through the file line by line.
%
%Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
%\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
%environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.
%
%Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
%will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
%equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
%article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
%the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
%counting.
%
%{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
%data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
%bibliography you must send the .bib files. 
%
%{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
%subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
%referenced as Table IV-B3. 
%
%{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
%\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
%supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
%cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
%should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.
%
%Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
%will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
%any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
%surrounding equation.
%
%\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
%\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
%\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
%\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
%\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
%\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
%\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
%\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
%\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
%\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
%\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
%\end{itemize}
%An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.
%
%\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
%\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
%minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
%should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
%next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
%and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
%affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
%example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).
%
%\subsection{Identify the Headings}
%Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
%your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.
%
%Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
%topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
%References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
%``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
%table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
%style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
%down menu to differentiate the head from the text.
%
%Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
%example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
%material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
%sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
%and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
%should be introduced.
%
%\subsection{Figures and Tables}
%\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
%bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
%figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
%below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
%figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
%``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

%
%Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
%rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
%avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
%``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
%units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
%with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
%\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
%quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
%``Temperature/K''.
%
%\section*{Acknowledgment}
%
%The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
%an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
%G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
%acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

%\section*{References}
%
%Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
%sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
%number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
%the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''
%
%Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
%the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
%abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.
%
%Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
%``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
%submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
%that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
%Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
%element symbols.
%
%For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
%citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
